This project would not be possible without the generous work of people like:

* `ProPublica's News Application Desk <http://www.propublica.org/nerds>`_, and particularly `Jeff Larson <https://github.com/thejefflarson>`_, who developed the Ruby libraries `table-fu <https://github.com/propublica/table-fu>`_ and `table-setter <https://github.com/propublica/table-setter>`_.
* `Chris Amico <https://github.com/eyeseast>`_, who did the noble work of porting table-fu to `Python <https://github.com/eyeseast/python-tablefu>`_.
* Christian Bach, the man who gave us `tablesorter <http://tablesorter.com/docs/>`_.
* The army of people who make something like `google-app-engine-django <http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-django/>`_ possible.
