Getting started
===============

This tutorial will walk you through the process of installing Table Stacker and publishing an example.

**Requirements**

* `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_
* `python <http://www.python.org/>`_

**01. Install the code on your computer**

It's not required, but I recommend creating a virtual environment to store your application. I like to do this with the Python module `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_, which creates a walled-off garden for the Python code to work without distraction from the outside world. If you don't have it, you'll need to install it now, which just might be as easy as

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install virtualenv
    # Or maybe ...
    $ sudo easy_install install virtualenv
    # Or, if you're in Ubuntu ...
    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

Once you have virtualenv installed, make it happen by navigating to wherever you keep your code and firing off the following. I'm going to call this project ``my-table-stacker``, but you should substitute whatever you're calling your version.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages my-table-stacker

Now jump into the directory it creates.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd my-table-stacker

Activate the private environment with virtualenv's custom command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ . bin/activate

Download the latest version of the code repository into a directory called ``project``. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/datadesk/latimes-table-stacker.git project

And jump in and get ready to work.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd project

Install our app's Python dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the project's database

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py syncdb

**02. Build the example tables**

You'll learn how to layout your own data later, but for now we'll work with the example files. Jump back to your first terminal shell and drop the following line, which instructs our ``build`` management command to bake out a static site using the instructions in ``settings.py`` and the table recipes in the ``yaml`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py build

**03. Launch the static version of the site**

You'll want to run this step in a new terminal shell. So open up a new window or tab, navigate to the ``project`` directory and fire off the following. It is a Django management command that will start a test version of the site on your machine, tailored to serve the static files we used created.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py buildserver

**04. Check it out**

If everything clicked, you should see your demo site up and running with all the example tables at `http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_.

**05. Deploy your app**

The static files we've created in your ``build`` directory could probably be served from most common web servers. So, if you've already
got yours worked out, you can just stop here and deploy that folder where you like. 

However, the app is prepared to help you easily deploy to `Amazon S3 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3>`_. To make that happen, you'll need to do a little set up. First, go to `aws.amazon.com/s3 <http://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ and set up an account. Then you'll need to create a bucket for storing our files. If you need help there are some basic instructions `here <http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/>`_.

Next configure the bucket to act as a website. Amazon's official instructions say to do the following::

    In the bucket Properties pane, click the Website configuration tab. 

    Select the Enabled check box.

    In the Index Document Suffix text box, add the required index document name (index.html).

Before you leave that pane, note the URL at the bottom. This is where your site will be published.

Now, set your bucket name in the `settings.py` file.::

    AWS_BUCKET_NAME = 'table-stacker'

Next, install `s3cmd <http://s3tools.org/s3cmd>`_, a utility we'll use to move files back and forth between your desktop and S3. In Ubuntu, that's as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install s3cmd

If you're Mac or Windows, you'll need to `download the file <http://s3tools.org/download>`_ and follow the installation instructions you find there.

Once it's installed, we need to configure s3cmd with your Amazon login credentials. Go to Amazon's `security credentials <http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key>`_ page and get your access key and secret access key. Then, from your terminal, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ s3cmd --configure

Finally, now that everything is set up, publishing your files to s3 is as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py publish

Once you do that, your site should appear at the the link provided in your AWS console. If you want to bind that to a subdomain of your site, say, www.tablestacker.com, you need to create a new CNAME record in your domain's DNS registration. You also need the name of your bucket to line up with the subdomain. Don't take it from me. Read the detailed instructions provided by Amazon. 

.. code-block:: text

    For example, if you have registered domain, www.example-bucket.com, you 
    could create a bucket www.example-bucket.com, and add a DNS CNAME entry 
    pointing to www.example-bucket.com.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com. 
    All requests to http://www.example-bucket.com will be routed to 
    www.example-bucket.com.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com.

More documentation on that is available `here <http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?WebsiteHosting.html>`_.

**06. Publish you own data table**

Before you can publish your own data table, you'll need to learn about our YAML-based configuration system. But don't worry, it's not that hard. You can read about it in the configuration section or school yourself by mimicking the examples files in the project's ``yaml`` subdirectory folder. Then, doing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py build
    $ python manage.py publish


Configuration
=============

Each published table is drawn from a CSV file you provide and styled according to the rules outlined in a configuration file written in `YAML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ configuration file. CSV files are stored in the ``csv`` folder in the root directory. YAML configuration files are stored in the ``yaml`` folder, with one configuration per file.

Example
-------
Here is an example YAML configuration that specifies how to layout `this demonstration table <http://table-stacker.appspot.com/major-us-coal-mines-2009/>`_. ::

    table:
      title: Major U.S. coal mines, 2009
      file:  major-us-coal-mines-2009.csv
      slug: major-us-coal-mines-2009
      byline: Ben Welsh
      description: <p>A list of the largest coal-producing U.S. mines for the year 2009. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports the production of all mines that produce more than 4 million short tons. In 2009, 47 mines qualified by the list. All together, major mines produced more than 650 million short tons of coal, a majority of the roughly 1 billion total short tons unearthed across the nation. Wyoming mines dominate the list, filling out the first nine positions.</p>

        per_page: 50

.. attribute:: show_download_links

    Whether download links for CSV, XLS and JSON data should be made available on the table detail page. The default is true, so you only need to include it when you want to turn downloads off.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        show_download_links: false

.. attribute:: show_search_field

   Whether or not to show a search box on the table detail page that filters the table. The default is true, so you only need to include it when you want to turn the search off.

        show_search_field: false

.. attribute:: show_in_feeds

    Whether the table will show in the sitemap, RSS feeds and public-facing list pages. The default is true, so you only need to include it when you want to set it to false.
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        show_in_feeds: false


Column Options
--------------

The following YAML configuration options specify how to present the columns in the data table. They should appear as entries in a dictionary titled ``column_options``.

.. attribute:: columns

    A list of the columns from the CSV that should appear in the published table. They will appear in the order specified here. Key names should correspond to headers in the CSV file. Optional.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        columns:
          - Mine
          - Company
          - Type
          - State
          - Production (Short tons)

.. attribute:: style

    A dictionary that specifies custom CSS to be applied to columns in the data table. CSS declarations should be included just as they would in an HTML ``style`` attribute. Key names should correspond to headers in the CSV file. Optional.

    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        style:
          Mine: 'text-align:left; width:250px;'
          Company: 'text-align:left; width:250px;'
          Type: "width:80px;"
          State: "width:100px;"

.. attribute:: sorted_by

    A single item list that specifies which column that table should be sorted by default, and which directions. Key names should correspond to headers in the CSV file. The direction can be either ``ascending`` or ``descending``. Optional.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        sorted_by:
          - Production (Short tons): descending

.. attribute:: sorters

    A dictionary that specifies how to properly sort columns in the interactive table. The JavaScript library that crafts the table attempts to guess the proper sorting method for each column, but sometimes it is wrong. Other times you might not want to sort a column at all, which can be done by setting the value to ``false``. You can use these options to declare what you'd like it do. A full list of the available sorters can be found `here <https://github.com/datadesk/latimes-table-stacker/blob/master/table_stacker/static/js/jquery.tablesorter.js#L696>`_. Optional. 

    .. code-block:: yaml

        sorters:
          Production (Short tons): fancyNumber
          Name: false

.. attribute:: formatting

    A dictionary that specifies formatting methods to be applied to all rows in a particular column. Each entry should include the column's name, 
    followed by a dictionary requesting a particular method and, if necessary, customization options and other columns to be passed in as arguments. Optional.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        formatting:
          Employees Affected:
            method: intcomma
          Company Name:
            method: title
          Title:
            method: link
            argument: url

    If you'd like to add a new filter of your own, open the ``table_fu/formatting.py`` file and add it there. Formatting filters are simple functions that accept a value and return the transformed value we'd like to present.

    .. code-block:: python

        def title(value):
            """
            Converts a string into titlecase.
            
            Lifted from Django.
            """
            value = value.lower()
            t = re.sub("([a-z])'([A-Z])", lambda m: m.group(0).lower(), value.title())
            return re.sub("\d([A-Z])", lambda m: m.group(0).lower(), t)

    After you've written a new filter, add it to the DEFAULT_FORMATTERS dictionary in that same file and you should now be available for use in YAML configuration files.

Management commands
===================

Interactions with the Table Stacker database are handled using custom `Django management commands <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/>`_ that allow you to create, update and delete tables.

Like other Django commands, they are run by interacting with the ``manage.py`` file in your project's root directory.

.. attribute:: build [options]
    
    Builds a static site with all the tables okayed for publication
    
    .. code-block:: bash
        
        $ python manage.py build

.. attribute:: buildserver [options]
    
    Delete the table outlined in the configuration file provided by the first argument.
    
    .. code-block:: bash
        
        $ python manage.py buildserver
        # Optionally, set the port for the server.
        $ python manage.py buildserver 8080

.. attribute:: publish [options]
    
    Sync the build directory with the Amazon S3 bucket specified in settings.py
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ python manage.py publish

.. attribute:: unbuild [options]
    
    Empties the build directory
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ python manage.py unbuild

.. attribute:: unpublish [options]
    
   Empties the Amazon S3 bucket defined in settings.py
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ python manage.py unpublish


Override sort with URL
======================

You can override the default sorting order of a table by appending a query string argument that provides an alternative. There are two required parameters. 

.. attribute:: sortColumn

    The index of the column that the table should sort by. Starts with zero from the left. So to sort by the first column, you would provide ``0``.

.. attribute:: sortOrder

    The direction the column should sort in. ``0`` will sort in the ascending. ``1`` will sort in the descending.

Here is an example of resorting a table by the first column in ascending order.

.. code-block:: text

    http://table-stacker.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/california-layoffs-december-2010/?sortColumn=0&sortOrder=0


Customization
=============

Table Stacker is published with `minimal styling <http://table-stacker.appspot.com/>`_. If you want to adapt it for your site, you'll probably want to change the appearance and layout. The CSS styles that regulate the appearance of Table Stacker are stored in the ``/static/css`` directory. Change them and you'll change the appearance of the site. Table Stacker's layout is managed using `Django's templating system <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/>`_ and configured through a series of files in the ``templates`` directory. Change them and you'll change the layout of the site.

Global settings
---------------

.. attribute:: SITE_NAME

    A ``settings.py`` configuration that sets the site's name in meta data around the site, like the title tag and Facebook open graph tags.

.. attribute:: FACEBOOK_ADMINS

    A list of Facebook user ids included in the open graph tags in each page's head. Useful for configuring the site's footprint on Facebook. Set in ``settings.py``.

This project would not be possible without the generous work of people like:

* `ProPublica's News Application Desk <http://www.propublica.org/nerds>`_, and particularly `Jeff Larson <https://github.com/thejefflarson>`_, who developed the Ruby libraries `table-fu <https://github.com/propublica/table-fu>`_ and `table-setter <https://github.com/propublica/table-setter>`_.
* `Chris Amico <https://github.com/eyeseast>`_, who did the noble work of porting table-fu to `Python <https://github.com/eyeseast/python-tablefu>`_.
* Christian Bach, the man who gave us `tablesorter <http://tablesorter.com/docs/>`_.
* Thomas Suh Lauder, who has suggested many style improvements and formatting options.
